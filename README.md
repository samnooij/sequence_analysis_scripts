# Sequence analysis scripts

A collection of scripts that I made and/or used to analyse biological sequences.

Most of my scripts are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
Required packages/modules ase usually downloaded and installed with 
[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html).
